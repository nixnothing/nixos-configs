# nixos-configs
repo for nixos configs

plan to break down by machine and machine intent and related toolsets and package catagories.

- hypervisor project config results (xen/nix vm spinup, deployment configs, etc)
- Home/personal machines config & packages
- lightweight (pi & arm)
- Media Center barebones
- media processing station (transcoding tools, gimp, players, iso tools, 3d modeling (need to explore)
- config based just around dev tools/ides (pain to configure on the spot)
- guest/generic end user (general tech enthusiest)
